# shopify-data-export
Small python script that I use to export all order and customer info into local csv files. 
The script isn't set up to just get cloned and run, you need to connect it to a Shopify private app
that you need to manually set up.

Overall very (very!) sloppy file, but hopefully is helpful providing a function that Shopify doesn't have currently.

## TODO
1. Set up template config file
2. Refactor main.py into functions that can be called from terminal to export customer and order data instead of making the user comment out and edit arrays within the code
3. Write up an indepth installation on how to connect the script to a Shopify Private app
